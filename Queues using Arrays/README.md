Dynamic Queue Implementation

This folder contains the implementation of a Dynamic Queue using an array with a wrap-around mechanism. The queue is designed to handle dynamic resizing efficiently when the underlying array overflows, ensuring optimal memory usage.
The queue is built using four integer variables to manage the queueâ€™s capacity, size, front, and last items. The Integer class is used for the internal array to allow for flexible, nullable elements.
